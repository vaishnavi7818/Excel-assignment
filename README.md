# Streaming Service User Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project is a part of my **Hero Vired Certificate Program in Data Analytics**.  
The main objective of this work is to analyze user behavior on a streaming service platform, study how often users log in, what content they download, and find out the key patterns in their engagement.  

## Project Files  
- **streaming_service_data.csv copy.xlsx** → Dataset used for analysis  
- **Streaming Service User Analysis ppt.pptx** → Presentation with all my findings and conclusions  

## Tools & Technologies  
- Microsoft Excel (for data cleaning, preparation, and analysis)  
- Microsoft PowerPoint (for presenting the insights)  

## What I Did in the Project  
- Checked and handled missing values and outliers  
- Performed statistical calculations (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, min, max)  
- Looked into frequency of logins and content downloads  
- Studied user engagement and content consumption patterns  
- Summarized insights with charts and visuals  

## Key Outcomes  
- Clear understanding of what type of content users prefer  
- Observed login and download trends  
- Identified engagement patterns that can help improve the streaming platform  

## How to Use  
1. Open the dataset file (`.xlsx`) in Excel (or any tool of your choice).  
2. Check the PowerPoint (`.pptx`) to go through my analysis and conclusions.  
3. The same dataset can also be used in Python or any other tool if you want to extend the analysis.
